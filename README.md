MLkit face detection API and code uses

FaceContourGraphics.java
---------------------------------------------
This code helps updates the face instance from the detection of the most recent frame and draws the face
annotations for position on the supplied canvas.  




GraphicOverlay.java
---------------------------------------------
The code in this file was used from the official site of firebase. This code renders a series of custom graphics to be 
overlayed on top of an associated preview (i.e., the camera preview). 
The creator can add graphics objects, update the objects, and remove them, triggering the appropriate drawing and
invalidation within the view.


LoadImageHere.java
---------------------------------------------
In this file I am loading the Image taken from the camera to run the face contour and graphic overlay after detecting face.


MainActivity.java
---------------------------------------------
In this file there will be codes for the buttons, and that are responsible for naviagation
into the other activites like LoadImageHere.java.
